# Cityscape
### Type in a city, and get its data

#### Notes
- Backend data is created with php, which parses through a text file
- Frontend only uses a small amount of Bootstrap
- Currently only 3 cities as of 10.6.16

#### Cityscape is currently deployed on [UW Student Servers](https://students.washington.edu/swifties/cityscape/cities.html)
